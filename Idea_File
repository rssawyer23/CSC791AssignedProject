1. Principal Component Analysis
    i.  Do a full PCA on all numeric values
        take top 8 eigenvectors
        use to create features
        discretize features
        run 1 through 8 to find best ECR
    ii. Do PCA on each type of feature (from Feature_Table)
        For each type: run PCA on type, select top eigenvector, make features from each type

2. Clustering
    i. Basic: Use K-Means on data points to create variable for cluster number
    ii. Extra: Use several different numbers of clusters for multiple variables
    iii. Use several different clustering methods (K-Means, [discretized] GMM, DBSCAN, Hierarchical) for multiple features
    iv. Could also cluster from each type for feature per type

3. Combination
    i. Use clustering for some variables and PCA for other variables
